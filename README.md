# Code-Quiz

The html files are basic with some bootstrap and two css components.
The most important thing in index.html is the links for the different quizes.

For index2.html the questions are created based off of the code.
The header is already there in the html. The seconds are counted down by the js and the wrong or right answer is added after the first answer is selected.


The value is passed through and checked in script2.js to see which questions and answers should come up.
